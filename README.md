# TerraComp
WIP Terraria Computer (Currently only 4 Bit with limited instructions)

## Stats
Currently has 7 instructions (see [Instruction set](https://github.com/Coolbob134/TerraComp/blob/main/InstructionSet.md)), 3 Registers and 240 bit program memory (enough for 30 instructions).

Clock speed is currently +/- 4Hz. 

Output is 5 'lights' representing 5 bits.

## [Assembler](https://github.com/Coolbob134/TerraComp/blob/main/TerracompAssembler.py)
The assembler converts instructions from a text file into machine code that can be written into program memory.

## [Simulator](https://github.com/Coolbob134/TerraComp/blob/main/TerracompSim.py)
Simulates the computer, to simplify debugging and development of programs written for the computer.

## [Experimental Simulator](https://github.com/Coolbob134/TerraComp/blob/main/TerracompSimExperimental.py)
Experimental version of the simulator, closer to an actual compiler. It has Jump, Return and is 8 bit.



  
## PLEASE NOTE
As of late 2023 I am busy with my matric exams. Expect a slowdown in development.
